This repository is a starting project folder for **IntelliJ Idea Community** for students. It includes all of the sample Java code used in this course, as well as text and image files needed for assignments and exams. Students should typically only have to download (clone) this repository once at the beginning of the term. Doing so more than once could overwrite any assignments or exams already stored here.
